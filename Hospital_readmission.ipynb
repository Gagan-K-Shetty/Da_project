        "Hospital readmission measures have been touted not only as a quality measure, but also as a means to bend the healthcare cost curve. In the United States, hospital readmissions within a span of 30 days turn out to be an immense burden on the healthcare system and the patient's lifestyle.<br><br>\n",
        "A USFC study in the US shows that 27% of readmissions are potentially avoidable through better diagnosis at discharge or having a predictive mechanism to evaluate the chance of a patient being readmitted based on various factors. The cost per readmission in the US varies from 10 to 14 thousand dollars, subject to the insurance plan, medical facilities utilized etc.<br><br>\n",
        "For this purpose, we intend to perform data analytics on the electronic health records of patients and determine the main indicators of hospital readmission and predict the chances of readmission in the future for the current patients.\n"

        "You might have noticed that according to the admission date, admission events occured between 2100 to 2200 even though the events actually occured between 2001 and 2012. The reason for this is that before data was incorporated into the MIMIC-III database, it was first deidentified in accordance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) standards using structured data cleansing and date shifting. The deidentification process for structured data required the removal of all eighteen of the identifying data elements listed in HIPAA, including fields such as patient name, telephone number, address, and dates. In particular, dates were shifted into the future by a random offset for each individual patient in a consistent manner to preserve intervals, resulting in stays which occur sometime between the years 2100 and 2200. Time of day, day of the week, and approximate seasonality were conserved during date shifting. Dates of birth for patients aged over 89 were shifted to obscure their true age and comply with HIPAA regulations: these patients appear in the database with ages of over 300 years. Since the intervals are preserved, this won’t create any issues as we are interested in the differences in the times(lenght of stay, age, readmission, etc) Lets go ahead and convert the remaining dates as well."

        "Now, to calculate the readmits within 6 months, we need to compare the admit time and discharge time. However, one important question arises here, what if the readmission was completely unrelated to the previous diagnosis? For this case we can compare diagnosis related to the admission and consider the case only if the diagnosis is same. This way we can say a subject was readmitted within 6 months for a problem similar to the one he had before. However, we will be ignoring the cases where a person is readmitted and diagnosed with a problem different than the one he had before, but was due to the problem he had before. To fix this, we need a very good domain knowledge. For the scope of this project, we are going to consider every readmission. Let's go ahead and calculate the target variables."

The number of comorbid conditions can be used to provide an indication of the health status (and risk of death) of patients.

        "The Charlson Comorbidity Index is a method of categorizing comorbidities of patients based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes found in administrative data, such as hospital abstracts data. Each comorbidity category has an associated weight (from 1 to 6), based on the adjusted risk of mortality or resource use, and the sum of all the weights results in a single comorbidity score for a patient. A score of zero indicates that no comorbidities were found. The higher the score, the more likely the predicted outcome will result in mortality or higher resource use.
